      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        In 1991, Suzanne Collins began her professional career writing for children’s television. She worked on the
        staffs of several Nickelodeon shows, including the Emmy-nominated hit Clarissa Explains it All and The Mystery
        Files of Shelby Woo. For preschool viewers, she penned multiple stories for the Emmy-nominated Little Bear and
        Oswald. She also co-wrote the Rankin/​Bass Christmas special, Santa, Baby! with her friend, Peter Bakalian,
        which was nominated for a WGA Award in Animation. Most recently she was the Head Writer for Scholastic
        Entertainment’s Clifford’s Puppy Days,and a freelancer on Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! While working on a Kids WB show
        called Generation O! she met children’s author and illustrator James Proimos, who talked her into giving
        children’s books a try.

        Thinking one day about Alice in Wonderland, she was struck by how pastoral the setting must seem to kids who,
        like her own, lived in urban surroundings. In New York City, you’re much more likely to fall down a manhole
        than a rabbit hole and, if you do, you’re not going to find a tea party. What you might find...? Well, that’s
        the story of Gregor the Overlander, the first book in her five-part fantasy/​war series, The Underland
        Chronicles,which became a New York Times bestseller. It has been sold into 21 foreign territories.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her next series, The Hunger Games Trilogy, is an international bestseller. The Hunger Games has spent over six
        years to date on The New York Times bestseller list since publication in September 2008, and has also appeared
        consistently on USA Today and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists. It has been sold into 56 territories in 51
        languages. In 2010 Collins was named to the TIME 100 list as well as the Entertainment Weekly Entertainers of
        the Year list.

        Lionsgate released a film adaptation of THE HUNGER GAMES on March 23, 2012, directed by Gary Ross who also
        shared screenplay credit with Suzanne and Billy Ray. It broke multiple box office records and went on to become
        the 14th highest-grossing North American release of all time on its way to generating nearly $700 million at
        the worldwide box office. Lionsgate released the second installment THE HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE worldwide
        on November 22, 2013, directed by Francis Lawrence from a screenplay by Simon Beaufoy and Michael DeBruyn and

        Willow Shields, Paula Malcomson, Donald Sutherland, Stanley Tucci and Lenny Kravitz along with new cast members
        Philip Seymour Hoffman, Sam Claflin, Jena Malone and Jeffrey Wright. It was the highest-grossing domestic box
        office release of 2013 and the 10th highest-grossing domestic release of all time. Lionsgate will release THE
        HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY – PART 1 on November 21, 2014 and THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY – PART 2 on November
